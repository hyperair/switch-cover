Switch Cover
============

Introduction
------------

This is a 3D printable switch cover that that covers a power strip switch and
hopefully offers a strong enough message to prevent people with itchy fingers
from turning them off.

I built this after someone switched my office server off for the umpteenth time.
If this cover fails to work, it will be extended to incorporate padlock holes.
